# HKU DASE7506 MP2 — frozen round214

Select one of four supplied GSM8K candidate solutions using comparative
ranking and strict numerical verification.

| Recorded result | Correct / total |
| --- | --- |
| Validation | 760 / 798 (95.2381%) |
| Test, from the existing frozen evaluation | 391 / 467 (83.7259%) |
| Internal held training fold | 1477 / 1582 |

The recorded evaluation passed 137 interface/protocol checks. The checkpoint
contains 15,824,973 bytes (15.0919 MiB). The historical local fresh test
prediction plus scoring time was 25.52 seconds on an i7-11800H, four threads.
This does not certify timing on the course reference machine.

## Reproduce frozen inference

Use Python 3.11 or 3.12 and install requirements.txt in a separate environment.
Place the **provided course data** in DASE7506-MP2-main/code/data/, preserving
its original candidates/ subdirectory and manifest. The public source is
[the official course distribution](https://github.com/xudongwu-0/DASE7506-MP2).
This repository carries the unchanged official Python evaluator and data
license/notice. No pretrained weights or external datasets are required.

From the repository root on Linux:

    export OMP_NUM_THREADS=4 OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=4 MKL_NUM_THREADS=4 NUMEXPR_NUM_THREADS=4
    python DASE7506-MP2-main/code/predict.py --method experiments/round214/frozen/method/entrypoint.py --checkpoint experiments/round214/bundle --split validation --output remote-work/validation_predictions.json
    python DASE7506-MP2-main/code/score_predictions.py --predictions remote-work/validation_predictions.json --split validation --output remote-work/validation_score.json

Expected validation count: **760/798**. The frozen entrypoint prevents the
prediction process from opening reference-answer files.

## Contents and provenance

- experiments/round214/bundle/: canonical inference checkpoint.
- experiments/round214/frozen/: original evaluation records, source snapshot,
  hashes, and an identical archival checkpoint copy. Only one checkpoint
  copy is loaded for inference; the duplicate is retained for hash auditing.
- report/report.pdf and report/report.md: existing English report.
- research/: development and training source archive.
- experiments/round224/: subsequent unsuccessful train-held experiment;
  it does not change the frozen submitted candidate.

The training scripts are preserved as a staged research archive. Rebuilding
all stages requires their intermediate artifacts or rerunning the upstream
stages; this snapshot does not claim a single-command from-scratch rebuild.
Frozen inference is complete and does not require retraining.

Student ID is still a placeholder. Website submission has not been performed
by publishing this repository. SUBMISSION_README.md is the original handoff
document; use the commands above for the standalone frozen checkpoint.

The test result above is the already recorded result. Ongoing development
uses training and validation only. A new method must pass validation >760
and internal held >=1477 before a separately authorized test evaluation.
The remote deployment deliberately omits every test input/reference file.

AI assistance: the original pipeline/report disclosed Claude Code; subsequent
research, packaging and deployment assistance used OpenAI Codex.
